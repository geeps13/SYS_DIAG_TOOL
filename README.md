# SYS_DIAG_TOOL
I am making a system diagnostic tool that uses cmd commands to run the diagnostic. It basically exist to save you time from entering in the commands yourself.

THE README BELOW IS COPIED AND PASTED FROM THE ALPHA READ ME [Directory https://github.com/geeps13/SYS_DIAG_TOOL/blob/master/SYS_DIAG_TOOL%20ALPHA/README.txt]


SYSTEM DIAG TOOL README

 !!! RUN WITH ADMINISTRATION PRIVILEGES !!!

I hope this helps. It is just a .exe version of a .bat file.

Runs commands:

 - powercfg -energy
 - SystemInfo
 - Netuse
 - CHKDSK /f C:\
 - SFC /SCANNOW
